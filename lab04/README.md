I chose to implement the Fizzbuzz program in java.
I used identical naming conventions to the elizir files for the functions.
3 major unit tests were devised to test the 3 major functions

## 5 Commit groups(results of the test are below)

## Basic Fizzbuzz function test

![FizzBuzz Test Results](fizzbuzz_test_1.png)

The function correctly returned values for Fizz, Buzz, Fizzbuzz, and a number that is neither.

## Hundred Test results

![Hundred Test](hundredtest.png)

this test simply made sure that the output of fizzbuzz() with no input parameters was correct.

## twoNumFail

![twoNumFail](twoNumFail.png)

My first iteration of the two parameter fizzbuzz(n, m) function was flawed because it always started the fizzbuzz count at 0

## Two Num Success

After finding the root of the problem with my tests, the new set of tests ran successfully.
