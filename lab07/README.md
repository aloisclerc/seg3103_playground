## BugSpot Project

### I compiled and ran the calculator application, then I installed the BugSpot Intellij Plugin and these were the results after running it on the CalCFrame.java file

### I analyzed all of the bug reports and made the necessary changes to fix them as requested in the lab slides.
### When the BugSpot scan was run again, this time there were no bugs

### After the bugspot scan I ran the tests once again to ensure that nothing was broken.
